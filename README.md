# smart-mirror-display
The smart mirror I worked on displays time, weather, calendar from web APIs on mirror via display. Using an ESP32 microcontroller and a TFT display, I created a smart mirror for this activity. The main objective 
of the smart mirror is to display real-time data, including the date, time, weather, and upcoming events, directly on the mirror surface without interfering with the user's reflection on the mirror.
